PITCH YOUR TRAINING!
What is a pitch? 
A short description of your idea that explains the training concept to anyone! 
You need to 'sell' your idea to possible trainees, supporters, or community leaders - convince participants to join your training! Your description should clearly explain who your training is for, why it is important and needed, and how it will happen. 
Your pitch should also explain your skills and goals!
When you are ready to make a pitch … you are ready to run your training!

PREPARE THE SPACE
Where will your training be held?
Inside or outside? 
Does the space have good light, and fresh air? 
Or good shade? 
Is it clean? Are there toilets? 
What equipment do you need? 
(tools, materials, computer, power, wifi?)
Are there enough chairs/tables? 
How do you organise the space?
Is it easy to find? Can you fit in everyone?
Make a checklist for all these points ...
include everything you think you need!

INTRODUCTION!
Get to know each other! Sharing information helps build trust. 
Icebreaker [Example]: Ask everyone to tell the group one thing they like and don’t like.
Invite participants to come up with the ground rules for the workshop.
Penalties! - if they break any of the rules - they are asked to do something like this: 
If you come late for training, you have to sing a song in your language, and you dance - in front of everyone!

[Find other icebreakers in the Open Training Resources] 

TRAINING SCENARIO
Role Play 
2 or more people act or perform a scenario 
Introduce the exercise and define the results you want to achieve
Split into groups, each group creates a challenge scenario to discuss
Select a topic for the role play and outline a script or conversation 
Conduct the role play - conversations, controversies … invite reflections from the group!

TAKE A BREAK!
Shake it up! Get fresh air and do an energiser!
One Example: The ‘Bicycle’ Energizer!
Stand in a circle, hands in front on your bicycle ‘handlebars’.
One person claps their hands - each clap makes the group ride faster!
Lift your feet and start pedalling your imaginary bicycle slowly
Pedal faster, knees up high wheels are spinning as you ride
Keep going faster, riding into the wind & pedal as fast as you can!


TRAINING SCENARIO
User Experience Design
Assess the needs and challenges of the community
Design prototype, product or service with users in mind (like a DIY water filter!)
Test with real users and ask for feedback on what works - and what doesn’t.
Revise & redesign until the product or service meets their needs!

DOCUMENTATION 
Be visible! Share your knowledge and experience!
Documentation is key to share and publish training resources as you create them.
Types of documentation: Impressions | Social Media | Process | Steps | Tutorial
Consider taking notes, photos & video as a design feature of your training.
Document each of the steps and make examples to publish your tutorials.
Make your tutorials available in an open repository that anyone can easily access. This is how you can #BeTheChange in your community!

ENCOURAGE WOMEN & GIRLS 
GENDER EQUALITY & ACTIVE PARTICIPATION FOR ALL!
Considering gender equality needs to be actively embedded into the training.
Create safe spaces for women to meet, express challenges & listen to their needs.
Also meet with the men to encourage them to listen & give a chance to the ladies! 
Make space and time for women to actively participate and become more confident. 
Remember to support shy participants of any gender who are not so confident!
Anyone who wants to be a trainer or mentor, sharing their skills and experience should be encouraged to do so!

WHERE TO START?
Decide what is most important! 
Needs assessment: Identify the needs of participants and their communities.
Decide on topic, search for similar content and tools on open source repositories online. You’ll find lots of material to help design your workshop!
Invite participants with relevant interests / experience to take part in the training. 
Actively invite women to participate & overcome barriers to attending training.      Create safe space for learning - what do you say/do in front of your trainees?    

Co-create Rules for the Training:
Ground rules [some examples … ] 
Time Management = Respect = Active Participation
Phones on silent! Everyone can participate in keeping the training space clean. 
Invite participants to take on roles eg. timekeeper or reminder of ground rules
Give KUDOS during training - set up a Kudo Box to collect notes of appreciation, then read and share them with the group after the training.

WHO IS ON YOUR TEAM?
Trainings work best if you have a team!
Identify mentors, co-trainers, energisers - not all roles are needed for every training
Group size: about 10 to 15 people per trainer
Lead Trainer | Facilitator | experienced in the area of training
Documentation | Media Captain | pay attention to what you are taking pictures of! Expressions, actions, details are all important.
Co-Trainer | Mentor | try to involve local experts or community members
Entertainer | Motivator | someone to help keep the energy high, and support the trainer with small tasks …. or emergencies!
