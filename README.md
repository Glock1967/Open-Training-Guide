\#ASKnet - Sharing Skills and Knowledge

\#ASKnet is a peer to peer community network that aims to raise media literacy and increase access to information for young innovators in and from South Sudan, Uganda and Kenya. Creating a network of trainers, the #ASKnet community hubs are working together to share their skills and experience. In 2018 #ASKnet workshop participants included local Rhino Camp community members, joined by prospective trainers from Bidibidi refugee settlement (Yumbe district), Adjumani district, the Kiryandongo refugee settlement (Bweyale) as well as South Sudan and Kenya.
